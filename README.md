# Basic Testing with Node.js and Jest

This repository contains unit tests for a Node.js project, focusing on different testing techniques and tools such as Jest. The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate proficiency in writing tests for various scenarios like simple unit tests, table-driven tests, error handling, class testing, partial mocking, Node.js API mocking, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment is to write comprehensive unit tests for code provided in the repository using **Jest**. This includes testing functions, handling errors, mocking APIs, and creating snapshot tests.

The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different testing strategy:
- Simple Tests
- Table-Driven Tests
- Error Handling & Asynchronous Functions
- Testing Classes
- Partial Mocking
- Mocking Node.js API
- Mocking Library API
- Snapshot Testing

## Prerequisites

To run and test the code, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js v20.x.x LTS** or higher
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

npm run test
```

### Run Unit Tests with Verbose Logging
```bash
npm run test:verbose
```

After running the tests, you will see the number of passing, failing, and skipped tests in the terminal.

## Testing Sections

## Simple Tests

In this section, we write basic unit tests for the `simpleCalculator` function. Unit testing involves verifying that individual units of code (like functions or classes) work as expected. Tests are written in `src/01-simple-tests/index.test.ts`.

### What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing is a software testing method where individual pieces of code, such as functions or methods, are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. It helps ensure that each function performs as expected under various input conditions.

### Example of a Unit Test in Jest

```typescript
test('adds 5 + 3 to equal 8', () => {
  expect(simpleCalculator(5, 3, '+')).toBe(8);
});
```

This test checks if adding 5 and 3 using the `simpleCalculator` function returns the expected value, 8.

## Table Tests

In this section we rewrite the tests using **table-driven tests** to rewrite the tests for the `simpleCalculator` function. Table-driven testing organizes multiple test cases into a "table" or array of test data, allowing you to loop over the inputs and expected outputs instead of writing separate test cases for each. This helps in avoiding repetitive code and makes it easier to maintain and extend test cases. Tests are written in `src/02-table-tests/index.test.ts`.

### What is Table-Driven Testing?

Table-driven testing allows you to test multiple scenarios in a more organized and efficient way. Instead of writing separate test cases for each input/output pair, you define a "table" of test cases (usually an array of objects in code) and loop over them to execute the same logic.

### Example of Table-Driven Test with Jest

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a table-driven test in Jest:

```typescript
describe('simpleCalculator', () => {
  const testCases = [
    { a: 5, b: 3, action: '+', expected: 8 },
    { a: 5, b: 3, action: '-', expected: 2 },
    { a: 5, b: 3, action: '*', expected: 15 },
    { a: 9, b: 3, action: '/', expected: 3 },
    { a: 2, b: 3, action: '^', expected: 8 },
    { a: 5, b: 3, action: 'invalid', expected: null },
  ];

  test.each(testCases)('$a $action $b should return $expected', ({ a, b, action, expected }) => {
    const result = simpleCalculator(a, b, action);
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

In this example, `test.each` allows us to iterate over the `testCases` array, running the same test logic for each case.

## Error Handling & Async

In this section, we write tests for functions that handle errors and asynchronous operations. These tests verify that the functions correctly handle exceptions and resolve or reject as expected. Tests are written in `src/03-error-handling-async/index.test.ts`.

### What is Error Handling & Asynchronous Testing?

Error handling tests ensure that the code properly throws or rejects errors under exceptional conditions. Asynchronous testing verifies that functions using promises, `async`/`await`, or callback patterns work correctly, ensuring that they resolve or reject as expected.

### Real Test Cases:

1. **`resolveValue` Function:**
   This test ensures that the `resolveValue` function returns the provided value after resolving a promise.

   ```typescript
   describe('resolveValue', () => {
     test('should resolve provided value', async () => {
       const value = 'test';
       const resolvedValue = await resolveValue(value);
       expect(resolvedValue).toBe(value);
     });
   });
   ```

   - **Explanation:** The test calls `resolveValue` with the string `'test'`, and it expects the resolved value to be the same as the input.

2. **`throwError` Function:**
   These tests verify that the `throwError` function throws the appropriate error based on the input provided (or the default message if no input is provided).

   ```typescript
   describe('throwError', () => {
     test('should throw error with provided message', () => {
       expect(() => throwError('Custom message')).toThrow('Custom message');
     });

     test('should throw error with default message if message is not provided', () => {
       expect(() => throwError()).toThrow('Oops!');
     });
   });
   ```

   - **Explanation:**  
     - The first test checks that when a custom message (`'Custom message'`) is passed, `throwError` throws an error with that message.
     - The second test checks that if no message is provided, `throwError` throws an error with the default message `'Oops!'`.

3. **`throwCustomError` Function:**
   This test verifies that the `throwCustomError` function throws a custom error of the type `MyAwesomeError` with a specific message.

   ```typescript
   describe('throwCustomError', () => {
     test('should throw custom error', () => {
       expect(() => throwCustomError()).toThrowError(MyAwesomeError);
       expect(() => throwCustomError()).toThrowError(
         'This is my awesome custom error!',
       );
     });
   });
   ```

   - **Explanation:**  
     - The test first checks that `throwCustomError` throws an error of type `MyAwesomeError`.
     - Then it verifies that the error message is `'This is my awesome custom error!'`.

4. **`rejectCustomError` Function:**
   This test ensures that the `rejectCustomError` function rejects the custom error `MyAwesomeError` with the correct message.

   ```typescript
   describe('rejectCustomError', () => {
     test('should reject custom error', async () => {
       expect.assertions(2);
       try {
         await rejectCustomError();
       } catch (error) {
         expect(error).toBeInstanceOf(MyAwesomeError);
         const myError = error as MyAwesomeError;
         expect(myError.message).toBe('This is my awesome custom error!');
       }
     });
   });
   ```

   - **Explanation:**  
     - This test uses `expect.assertions(2)` to ensure that both assertions inside the `catch` block are executed.
     - It checks that the rejected error is an instance of `MyAwesomeError` and that the error message is `'This is my awesome custom error!'`.

## Testing Classes

In this section, we test a class representing a bank account, which handles various operations, some of which are asynchronous and might throw errors. Tests are written in `src/04-test-class/index.test.ts`.

### What is Class Testing?

Class testing ensures that the methods in a class work together as expected. In object-oriented programming, testing classes means testing individual methods as well as their interactions with each other.

### Example in Jest:

```typescript
test('should create a new bank account with initial balance', () => {
  const account = new BankAccount(100);
  expect(account.getBalance()).toBe(100);
});
```

## Partial Mocking

In this exercise, you're aiming to mock some functions (mockOne, mockTwo, mockThree) from the ./index module, but leave others (unmockedFunction) unchanged so they behave as usual. Tests are written in `src/05-partial-mocking/index.test.ts`.

### What is Partial Mocking?

Partial mocking is the practice of mocking only certain methods in a module or class while leaving others intact. This approach allows you to isolate specific functions for testing without affecting the functionality of unrelated parts of the module. It is especially useful when you want to mock only a subset of behaviors while retaining the original implementation for the rest.

## Example Setup

Below is an example of how to perform partial mocking in Jest using `jest.spyOn` to selectively mock methods in a module:

```typescript
jest.spyOn(myModule, 'functionToMock').mockImplementation(() => 'mocked result');
```

### Test Setup

We use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` to manage console logging during tests to ensure that console logs are suppressed during the test and restored after each test is completed. For example:

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  consoleSpy = jest.spyOn(console, 'log').mockImplementation(() => {});
});
```
```typescript
afterEach(() => {
  consoleSpy.mockRestore();
});
```

### Key Jest Functions
- **`jest.mock(moduleName, factory)`**: Replaces the entire module with a mock implementation. However, we can combine it with `jest.requireActual` to only mock certain functions, leaving others intact.
- **`jest.spyOn(object, methodName)`**: Creates a mock for a specific method on an object or module. This is helpful for partial mocking.
- **`mockImplementation(fn)`**: Defines a custom implementation for a mocked function.

## Mocking Node.js API

In this section, we test code that interacts with Node.js APIs like `fs`, `setTimeout`, or `setInterval`. By mocking these APIs, we can avoid real file system changes or relying on real-time behavior during tests. Additionally, we mock the `fs` module's `readFile` function using Jest. This helps us test file-reading logic without relying on the actual filesystem. The tests are written in `src/06-mocking-node-api/index.test.ts`.

### What is Node.js API Mocking?

**Node.js API Mocking** is a testing technique used to simulate the behavior of native Node.js APIs such as file system operations (`fs`), timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`), HTTP modules (`http`, `https`), and more. The goal of mocking these APIs is to avoid real interactions with external dependencies or hardware (like file systems or network calls) during tests, allowing you to isolate and test the behavior of your code in a controlled environment.

By mocking the Node.js APIs, you can:
- **Prevent unintended side effects**: Avoid modifying files or interacting with actual external resources during testing.
- **Speed up tests**: Eliminate real delays from timers or I/O operations, making the tests faster and more predictable.
- **Simulate different conditions**: Control the output of APIs, including error scenarios, without depending on the real environment.

### Key Benefits of Node.js API Mocking:
- **Control over behavior**: You can simulate successful or failed API interactions without depending on the actual system.
- **Efficiency**: You can reduce test run time by eliminating real I/O or network interactions.
- **Test reliability**: Tests won't fail because of external factors like unavailable files or network errors.

### Example of Mocking Node.js `fs` API

Below is a sample test for mocking the `fs` module in a Node.js project:

```typescript
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
import { processFile } from './fileProcessor';  // Example function that processes file content

jest.mock('fs/promises');

describe('processFile', () => {
  const fileContent = 'Mock file content';

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Mock the resolved value of readFile
    (readFile as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(fileContent);
  });

  test('should process file content correctly', async () => {
    const result = await processFile('test-file.txt');
    expect(result).toBe('Processed: Mock file content');
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();  // Clear mocks after each test
  });
});
```

### Explanation:
- **`jest.mock('fs/promises')`**: Mocks the `fs/promises` module so the real file system is not accessed.
- **`(readFile as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(fileContent)`**: Ensures that whenever `readFile` is called during the test, it resolves with the mocked file content (`fileContent`).
- **`jest.clearAllMocks()`**: Resets the mocked functions after each test, ensuring that the tests are independent.

### Key Jest Functions for Mocking:
- **`jest.mock(moduleName)`**: Automatically mocks all exports of a module.
- **`mockResolvedValue(value)`**: Mocks a function to return a resolved promise with the given value.
- **`jest.clearAllMocks()`**: Clears all mock calls and implementations.

7. **Mocking Library API**:  
   Test the functionality of a function that utilizes a third-party library, e.g., `axios` or `lodash`.

   Tests are written in `src/07-mocking-lib-api/index.test.ts`.

8. **Snapshot Testing**:  
   Use Jest's snapshot testing to ensure the consistency of output over time.

   Tests are written in `src/08-snapshot-testing/index.test.ts`.
